# **Re-use clothes**

## Czechitas Digital Academy Data project, Autumn 2024

The project focuses on comparing the supply of used and new clothing from data collected from four e-shops. The result is a demo application that allows users to filter the offer and view advertisements. The app includes the ability to display a visualisation that highlights the benefits of buying re-used clothing, such as sustainability and financial savings. The app **reuse.it** is designed to be ready for expansion with additional products and functionality. The project aims to promote awareness of the circular economy and facilitate purchasing decisions.
